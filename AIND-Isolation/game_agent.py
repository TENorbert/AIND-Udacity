        Parameters
        ----------
        game : isolation.Board
            An instance of the Isolation game `Board` class representing the
            current game state

        depth : int
            Depth is an integer representing the maximum number of plies to
            search in the game tree before aborting

        alpha : float
            Alpha limits the lower bound of search on minimizing layers

        beta : float
            Beta limits the upper bound of search on maximizing layers

        Returns
        -------
        (int, int)
            The board coordinates of the best move found in the current search;
            (-1, -1) if there are no legal moves

        Notes
        -----
            (1) You MUST use the `self.score()` method for board evaluation
                to pass the project tests; you cannot call any other evaluation
                function directly.

            (2) If you use any helper functions (e.g., as shown in the AIMA
                pseudocode) then you must copy the timer check into the top of
                each helper function or else your agent will timeout during
                testing.
