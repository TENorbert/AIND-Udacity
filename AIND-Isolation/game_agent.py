## NUMBER OF REMAINING MOVES + SIMPLE DISTANCE
def custom_score(game, player):
    """Calculate the heuristic value of a game state from the point of view
    of the given player.
    Heuristic combines:
        1) The number of player + opponent moves
        2) The distance(Simple)  measure to capture positional advantage
        3) Sum of Maximum moves over Minimal number of remaining squares.


    This heuristic value is simply the difference in the number of
    player's remaining moves and the opponent's remaining moves.
    The player wins(loss) if they have fewer(more) moves left compared to the opponent.

    If player and opponent have the same number of moves left
    use simple distance to center of board as additional evaluation.
    and if the players have the same simple distance to center of board,
    the their Sum of Maximum moves over Minimal number of remaining squares  is used.

    Since the simple distance factor of the heuristic function is secondary in influence to the
    number of remaining moves of a player, we devide by 10.
    and since the Sum of Maximum moves over Minimal number of remaining squares is tetiary
    overall effect to the heuristic function, we devide by 100.


    This should be the best heuristic function for your project submission.


    Parameters
    ----------
    game : `isolation.Board`
        An instance of `isolation.Board` encoding the current state of the
        game (e.g., player locations and blocked cells).

    player : object
        A player instance in the current game (i.e., an object corresponding to
        one of the player objects `game.__player_1__` or `game.__player_2__`.)

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The heuristic value of the current game state to the specified player.

    Parameters
    ----------
    search_depth : int (optional)
        A strictly positive integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3,...) for the number of
        layers in the game tree to explore for fixed-depth search. (i.e., a
        depth of one (1) would only explore the immediate sucessors of the
        current state.)

    score_fn : callable (optional)
        A function to use for heuristic evaluation of game states.

    timeout : float (optional)
        Time remaining (in milliseconds) when search is aborted. Should be a
        positive value large enough to allow the function to return before the
        timer expires.

        For fixed-depth search, this function simply wraps the call to the
        minimax method, but this method provides a common interface for all
        Isolation agents, and you will replace it in the AlphaBetaPlayer with

        ----------
        game : `isolation.Board`
            An instance of `isolation.Board` encoding the current state of the
            game (e.g., player locations and blocked cells).

        time_left : callable
            A function that returns the number of milliseconds left in the
            current turn. Returning with any less than 0 ms remaining forfeits
            the game.

        Returns
        -------
        (int, int)
            Board coordinates corresponding to a legal move; may return
            (-1, -1) if there are no available legal moves.
